You are a senior full-stack engineer + UI designer. Build a “Target CPA Calculator” web app (PPC Bidding Tool) that matches a modern dark-glass UI similar to the reference: three slider cards on top, a large results card below, and a formula strip at the bottom.

IMPORTANT: This is NOT a currency converter. It’s a PPC bidding calculator.

TECH STACK (Replit-friendly)
- React + Vite (JavaScript or TypeScript)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (preferred). If Tailwind setup fails, use clean CSS with the same look.
- No backend required (pure frontend) for MVP.
- Use localStorage for saving last used values.

UI REQUIREMENTS (Match screenshot layout)
1) Page (dark background with subtle gradient)
- Top pill label: “PPC Bidding Tool”
- Big title: “Target CPA Calculator”
- Subtitle: “Find your maximum cost per acquisition to stay profitable.”

2) Top 3 Cards (in one row on desktop; stack on mobile)
Card A: Lifetime Profit
- Icon on top-left (simple circle icon)
- Helper text: “Average profit per customer over their lifetime”
- Big value display (currency formatted) e.g. ₹5,000
- Slider:
  - Range: min 500 to max 100000
  - Step: 100
  - Default: 5000
- Show min and max labels under slider.

Card B: Acquisition Budget
- Helper text: “Percentage of profit allocated to customer acquisition”
- Big value display e.g. 50%
- Slider:
  - Range: min 5% to max 100%
  - Step: 1
  - Default: 50%

Card C: Conversion Rate
- Helper text: “Percentage of leads that become paying customers”
- Big value display e.g. 10%
- Slider:
  - Range: min 1% to max 100%
  - Step: 1
  - Default: 10%

3) Results Large Card (below)
Left side:
- Heading: “Your Target CPA”
- Big highlighted amount like ₹2500.00
- Caption: “Maximum you should pay per acquisition”

Right side (two lines with arrow icon):
- “Max cost per lead: ₹X.XX”
- “Profit retained per customer: ₹Y.YY”

4) Bottom formula strip
- Small bar with text:
  “Formula: Target CPA = Lifetime Profit × Acquisition Budget % × Conversion Rate %”

CALCULATION LOGIC (must match screenshot)
Inputs:
- lifetimeProfit (currency number)
- acquisitionBudgetPct (0–100)
- conversionRatePct (0–100)

Compute:
- targetCPA = lifetimeProfit * (acquisitionBudgetPct/100) * (conversionRatePct/100)

Also compute:
- maxCostPerLead = targetCPA * (conversionRatePct/100)
  (because CPA = CPL / ConversionRate -> CPL = CPA * ConversionRate)

- profitRetainedPerCustomer = lifetimeProfit - targetCPA

Formatting:
- currency symbol should be selectable:
  default “₹”
  add a small currency dropdown (₹, $, €, £, AED) — keep it minimal.
- Display with 2 decimals in results card.
- Sliders show big numbers without decimals where appropriate.

INTERACTIONS
- Smooth slider interactions; update results live as sliders move.
- Add “Reset” button (small) to set defaults.
- Save inputs to localStorage and restore on load.
- Responsive design: cards stack on mobile.

DESIGN STYLING GUIDELINES
- Dark glassmorphism cards (semi-transparent, soft border, subtle shadow)
- Accent color: teal/cyan highlights for slider track + big result text
- Rounded corners (large radius)
- Typography: bold title, muted helper text

DELIVERABLES
1) Full React + Vite project code
2) Components:
   - App layout
   - SliderCard component
   - ResultsCard component
   - CurrencyDropdown component
3) Utility functions for:
   - formatCurrency
   - clamp + parse
4) README for Replit:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev

QUALITY
- Code should be clean, commented, and easy to extend.
- No external paid UI kits required.

BONUS (optional)
- Add a small “Copy result” button to copy Target CPA.
- Add tiny tooltip icons explaining each metric.
